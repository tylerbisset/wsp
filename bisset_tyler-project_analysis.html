		<h1>Client: Christ Episcopal Church</h1>
		<h1>Website: <a href="www.christchurchseattle.org">www.christchurchseattle.org</a></h1>
		<h1>Designer: Tyler Bisset</h1>
		
		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The website for the Christ Episcopal Church has a number of areas that require 
			a re-design. The purpose of this redesign is to reorganize the content of the CEC 
			into 6 web pages. These pages will be more concise and will help increase internet 
			traffic to the site. This will in turn help raise awareness of the church in the 
			Seattle area and will increase visitors and members.</p>
			
			<p>Currently the CEC site does not validate according to the W3C validator test. 
			There are currently 52 HTML errors. In addition, the code used on the site is out 
			dated and needs to be brought up to the current web standards. The CEC website does 
			not use an external CSS style sheet which is a big contributing factor to the 
			validation errors and overall appearance of the site. For this re-design, an 
			external style sheet will be applied and the tables and other dividers will be 
			removed to help clean up the appearance.</p>
			
			<p>The layout and structure of the site also needs to be re-designed. Currently 
			there are two different navigation areas in columns on either side of the site. 
			These navigation areas are confusing and not very clear or different than the main 
			call to action. This re-design will remove the two navigations and add a horizontal 
			navigation bar at the top of the page which will incorporate the 6 pages. By doing 
			this, more space will be created for the main CTA area which will contain content 
			like news items.</p>
			
			<p>Finally the CEC website needs analytic data. Currently Alexa.com has very little 
			information about the CEC which is hurting business. This re-design will help 
			implement keywords and search engine optimization to increase traffic.</p>
			
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>The CEC is a Christian, historic, community driven organization. Their mission is 
			to be faithful to their mission as a parish, to know Christ, and to make Christ known 
			through prayer, liturgy, outreach, and Christian community.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Keywords:</strong></p>
			<p>Christian churches in Seattle, Seattle Christ church, Christ Episcopal Church, 
			Seattle Churches, Christ Church, Christian churches, Episcopal Church</p>
			
			<p><strong>Competitors:</strong></p>

			keywords using Google search:</p>

			<p>The main competitor for the CEC is the Mars Hill Church. With an Alexa traffic 
			rank of 80,703 globally and 23,399 in the US they dominate the church scene in 
			Seattle. They receive roughly 20% of their traffic through search engines and also 
			have a whopping 1,009 sites linking in. These statistics show the importance of

			in more traffic.</p>
